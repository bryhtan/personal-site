      <description>Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments. Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

      <title>Tangle Tabulation</title>

      <description>The classification of knots, links, and tangles has applications to fields including molecular biology where proteins are modeled by tangle equations. Online databases contain millions of knots and links including diagrams, notations, and properties. Tangles have not been classified to the same extent despite their close relation to knots and links and usefulness in applications. To build a database of 2-string tangles, we use a Conway-like notation to count and generate tangles using known canonical forms for rational, Montesinos, and generalized Montesinos tangles as building blocks.</description>

      <title>Classifying Non-Rational 2-String Tangles</title>

      <description>Classifying knots, links, and tangles is an ongoing process with applications to fields including molecular biology where protein actions may be modelled by tangle equations. For knots and links, there are databases which list thousands of these shapes including diagrams, notations, and properties. Tangles have not been published to the same level so, while properties can be found for a simple category of tangles (rational tangles), information is still needed for the more complex tangles.</description>

      <title>Need Helpful Math Papers?</title>

      <description>I was introduced to Keith Conrad when taking my first course in Abstract Algebra. His expository papers in Group and Ring theory were incredibly useful to me, and beyond that I was able to investigate so much more beyond course content in a digestible way. If you have not had the pleasure of perusing his expository papers, I encourage you to do so (they are all posted here )!</description>

      <title>A Guide to Conway Notation</title>

      <description>I first encountered J. Conway&amp;rsquo;s notation for knots the way I imagine most people do, by reading his original article &amp;ldquo;An enumeration of knots and links, and some of their algebraic properties.&amp;rdquo; While this was sufficient for a basic understanding, I found that the notation had evolved somewhat since 1970. I could not find a single convenient source covering common conventions, or the extensions discussed by A. Caudron in his paper &amp;ldquo;Classification des noeuds et des enlacements&amp;rdquo; (written completely in French).</description>

      <description>Multiple plugins used by thousands of teams that provide enhanced functionality of Atlassian&amp;rsquo;s core products (primarily JIRA and Bamboo) to enrich CI/CD capabilities, DevOps automation, or productivity. Functionality spans user interface, web services and persistence.</description>

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;JSON&amp;#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
