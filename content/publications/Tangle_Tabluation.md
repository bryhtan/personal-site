description: "The classification of knots, links, and tangles has applications to fields including molecular biology where proteins are modeled by tangle equations. Online databases contain millions of knots and links including diagrams, notations, and properties. Tangles have not been classified to the same extent despite their close relation to knots and links and usefulness in applications. To build a database of 2-string tangles, we use a Conway-like notation to count and generate tangles using known canonical forms for rational, Montesinos, and generalized Montesinos tangles as building blocks."
