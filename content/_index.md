Hey! My name is Zach and I am a fifth year Mathematics PhD student at the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu). My interests in many areas of math including commutative algebra, combinatorics, and knot theory. I am currently working with my advisor, Prof. Isabel Darcy, to complete a database of 2- string tangles with up to 10 crossings (think [KnotInfo](https://knotinfo.math.indiana.edu)).
