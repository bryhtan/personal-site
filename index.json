Online databases contain millions of knots and links including diagrams, notations, and properties. Tangles have not been classified to the same extent despite their close relation to knots and links and usefulness in applications. To build a database of 2-string tangles, we use a Conway-like notation to count and generate tangles using known canonical forms for rational, Montesinos, and generalized Montesinos tangles as building blocks.

Conway\u0026rsquo;s notation for knots the way I imagine most people do, by reading his original article \u0026ldquo;An enumeration of knots and links, and some of their algebraic properties.\u0026rdquo; While this was sufficient for a basic understanding, I found that the notation had evolved somewhat since 1970. I could not find a single convenient source covering common conventions, or the extensions discussed by A. Caudron in his paper \u0026ldquo;Classification des noeuds et des enlacements\u0026rdquo; (written completely in French). Finally I felt I had a great understanding of how Conway\u0026rsquo;s notation is being used, so to help others on their journey to understand the notation (and to have a convenient reference for myself) I wrote this guide.\nPrevious\rNext\rPrevious\rNext\r\u0026nbsp;\r\u0026nbsp;\rPage: / ","permalink":"https://bryhtan.github.io/blog/guide_to_conway/","tags":["tangle","knot","notation"],"title":"A Guide to Conway Notation"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Multiple plugins used by thousands of teams that provide enhanced functionality of Atlassian\u0026rsquo;s core products (primarily JIRA and Bamboo) to enrich CI/CD capabilities, DevOps automation, or productivity.
